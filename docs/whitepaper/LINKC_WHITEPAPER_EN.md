## 5. LinkC Platform Architecture

### 5.1 Four Core Principles

LinkC architecture design follows four core principles:

#### Principle One: Data is King, Applications are Secondary

```
Core Concept:
- Data is the core asset, applications are just interfaces to access data
- AI works based on data platform, not real-time queries each time
- Data continuously collected and accumulated, supporting intelligent decisions

Implementation:
- Data Collection Agent periodically collects robot status
- All MCP call results sink to data platform
- Data freshness mechanism avoids redundant queries
```

#### Principle Two: Agent as Core Unit

```
Core Concept:
- Capabilities encapsulated as Agents, not traditional functional modules
- Agents obtain capabilities via MCP, autonomously orchestrate tasks
- Agents have clear autonomy levels and responsibility boundaries

Implementation:
- Cleaning Scheduler Agent reaches Level 2 (event-driven proactive)
- Agent execution logs record complete reasoning process
- Agents interact via MCP Tools, not hardcoded
```

#### Principle Three: Human-in-the-Loop but Not in Critical Path

```
Core Concept:
- AI autonomously executes routine tasks without human confirmation
- Humans are supervisors and exception handlers, not approvers
- Complete escalation mechanism ensures critical issues reach humans

Implementation:
- Clearly defined autonomous execution boundaries
- Three-layer interface system (Trainer Workbench/Operations Console/Executive Dashboard)
- 4-level escalation mechanism (auto-handle to notify to confirm to emergency)
```

#### Principle Four: Composable and Evolvable

```
Core Concept:
- Capability units can be independently developed and combined
- System supports continuous learning and evolution
- Low-cost extension of new capabilities

Implementation:
- MCP Servers can be independently added and combined
- Scenario capability packages provide predefined combinations
- Agent Prompts can be updated to optimize behavior
```

### 5.2 Three-Layer Organizational Architecture

Level 2: Agent Handles + Notify Training Layer
  - Same robot multiple failures: Handle + notify
  - Cleaning coverage <80%: Handle + notify
  - 2 robots fail simultaneously: Handle + notify

Level 3: Request Human Confirmation (Operations Layer)
  - Robot needs maintenance: Generate work order, await confirmation
  - Schedule adjustment suggestion: Generate plan, await confirmation
  - Cleaning coverage <70%: Analyze cause, await decision

Level 4: Emergency Human Intervention (Strategic Layer)
  - All robots unavailable: Phone + SMS alert

### 6.2 Core Agent Introduction

#### Cleaning Scheduler Agent

**Basic Information**
- Autonomy Level: Level 2 (Event-Driven Proactive)
- Responsibility: Managing cleaning robot task assignment and collaborative scheduling

**Autonomous Execution Boundaries**
```
Can Execute Autonomously (No Confirmation Needed):
  - Dispatch cleaning tasks per schedule
  - Auto-dispatch charging when robot battery low
  - Auto-reassign tasks when robot fails
  - Respond to emergency cleaning requests
  - Adjust task execution order

Requires Human Confirmation:
  - Modify cleaning schedule templates
  - Create maintenance work orders
  - Disable robot for more than 24 hours
```

**Reasoning Process Example**
```json
{
  "trigger": "Robot R003 status changed to failure",
  "reasoning": [
    "Detected R003 failure, currently executing 3F lobby cleaning task",
    "3F lobby cleaning 65% complete, estimated 10 more minutes needed",
    "Find available robots: R001 idle (3F corridor), R002 charging (85%)",
    "R001 closest to 3F lobby (estimated 2 min arrival), select R001 to take over",
    "Decision: Transfer task to R001, continue cleaning from R003 stop position"
  ],
  "actions": [
    "Stop R003",
    "Dispatch R001 to 3F lobby",
    "R001 continues cleaning task"
  ],
  "outcome": "Transferred 3F lobby cleaning from R003 to R001, delay approx 3 minutes"
}
```

#### Conversation Agent

**Basic Information**
- Autonomy Level: Level 0 (Passive Response)
- Responsibility: Understanding user intent, executing queries and operation requests

**Interaction Examples**
```
User: "How is 3F cleaning today?"
Agent: "Today 3F overall cleaning coverage 95.2%, completed 8 cleaning tasks.
       Lobby area: 3 times, Corridors: 2 times, Meeting rooms: 3 times.
       1 anomaly: At 10:30 AM robot A-02 low battery returned early for charging,
       task taken over by A-05. Would you like to see the detailed report?"

User: "Schedule deep cleaning for meeting rooms tomorrow morning"
Agent: "OK, I will arrange deep cleaning for meeting rooms tomorrow morning.
       Suggested time: Tomorrow 8:00-9:00 (before meetings start)
       Recommended robot: A-03 (good deep cleaning mode support)
       Estimated duration: 45 minutes
       Confirm execution?"
